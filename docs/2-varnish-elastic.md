#### by sdarioz

In the previous sections we discussed advanced Varnish configurations. Another great way to enhance a Varnish deployment is to integrate it with Elastic Cloud for logging, metrics, and analytics.

## Overview of Elastic Stack

The Elastic Stack (formerly known as ELK) is made up of:

- **Elasticsearch** - Distributed search and analytics engine
- **Logstash** - Data processing and enrichment pipeline
- **Kibana** - Visualization and dashboarding interface

These can be deployed fully managed on Elastic Cloud.

## Logging with Filebeat

We can stream Varnish logs to Elasticsearch using Filebeat.

First, enable the Filebeat module for Varnish:

```
filebeat.modules:
  - module: varnish
    ...
```

This will collect Varnish access logs and ship them to Elasticsearch.

In Kibana, we can analyze request patterns, cache performance, response codes, etc.

## Metrics with Varnish Exporter

The [Varnish Exporter](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus-varnish-exporter) exposes Varnish metrics for Prometheus.

We can deploy it as a sidecar and configure Prometheus to scrape the metrics.

In Grafana, we can graph metrics like:

- Cache hit ratio
- Object expirations
- Backend health
- Memory usage
- Request volume

Alerts can also be created based on thresholds.

## Tracing with Elastic APM

To trace requests from the edge through to backends, [Elastic APM](https://www.elastic.co/apm) can be added to the application.

This instruments the app code to generate distributed traces. The traces are shipped to Elasticsearch where they can be analyzed in Kibana.

APM provides insights into request latency at each service level.

## Summary

Integrating Varnish with the Elastic stack provides:

- Logging for analytics and audit trails
- Metrics for monitoring and alerting
- Traces for distributed debugging

Running this stack on Elastic Cloud removes infrastructure management overhead so you can focus on gaining insights from the data.

With these techniques, you can get great observability into your Varnish deployment on Kubernetes.
